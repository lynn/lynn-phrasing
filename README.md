# lynn-phrasing
It's like [jeff-phrasing](https://github.com/jthlim/jeff-phrasing) but much smaller and a bit more pronunciation-based.

## Structure

It's basically "conjunction, pronoun, verb":

* `SKPAOER` → and we are
* `SKPWURBD` → but you should
* `SKPW*ERBD` → but he shouldn't
* `STHEUFB` → that I have been
* `SKHAEULZ` → which they will not
